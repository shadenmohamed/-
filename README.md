# -What is the purpose of this Robot? Nothing  except to discover few devices around the Arduino eco system and build a communication protocol between windows, ESP, Arduino and PI. 
Seriously this robot is able to process several commands, to run independently, to detect environmental changes and then send alerts and pictures to the Raspberry PI. 
For its part, the PI stores the data into text files and MySQL Database, and sends them via email.
